# Bug Report

### How to report an issue

If an issue / bug encountered while using **maestro**, we encourage you to report it in either our public [maestro slack channel](https://docsend.com/view/3r2sf8fvvcjxvbtk) or [create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/mobile-dev-inc/maestro/issues/new) (please make sure that one doesn't already exist).

### bugreport command

To provide more context if something hasn't worked as expected with **maestro** there is a command:

```
maestro bugreport
```

This command collects some data about Maestro usage locally on a user's machine. This data includes Maestro process logs and system info, such as maestro version, OS version, and device CPU architecture.

When creating a new issue / bug report in one of our channels please attach the .zip files generated in the folder specified after running `maestro bugreport` command.
