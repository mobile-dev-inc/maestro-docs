## Why Maestro?

Maestro builds on learnings from its predecessors—Appium, Espresso, UIAutomator, XCTest, Selenium, and Playwright—and allows you to easily define and test your flows.

{% hint style="info" %}
**What are flows?** Think of flows as parts of the user journey in your app. Login, Checkout, and Add to Cart are three examples of possible flows that you can define and test using Maestro.
{% endhint %}

* Built-in tolerance to flakiness. UI elements are not always where you expect them, and screen taps do not always go through. Maestro embraces the instability of mobile applications and devices and tries to counter it.
* Built-in tolerance to delays. No need to pepper your tests with `sleep()` calls. Maestro knows that it might take time to load the content (that is, over the network) and automatically waits for it, but no longer than required.
* Blazingly fast iteration. Tests run without compilation. Maestro continuously monitors your test files and reruns them as they change.
* Declarative yet powerful syntax. Define your tests in a YAML file.
* Simple setup. Maestro is a single binary that works anywhere.
