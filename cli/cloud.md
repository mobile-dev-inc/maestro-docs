### Robin

The easiest way to test your Flows in CI is to run your Flows on [Robin](https://www.robintest.com/). Since your flows run in the cloud there's no need to configure any simulators or emulators on your end. Check out the [**Robin Documentation**](../cloud/run-maestro-tests-in-the-cloud.md) to get started in less than 5 minutes:
