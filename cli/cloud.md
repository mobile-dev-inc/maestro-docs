# Cloud

The easiest way to test your Flows in CI is to [run your flows in the cloud](../cloud/run-maestro-tests-in-the-cloud.md). Since your flows run in the cloud there's no need to configure any simulators or emulators on your end.

```
maestro cloud --api-key <API_KEY> --project-id <PROJECT_ID> sample.zip ios-flow.yaml
```

Check out the cloud documentation to get started in less than 5 minutes:
