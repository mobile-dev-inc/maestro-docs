# View Hierarchy

You can use the Maestro CLI to directly inspect your app view hierarchy.

### hierarchy

`maestro hierarchy` prints out the whole view hierarchy that is currently being shown

```
maestro hierarchy
```

### query

`maestro query` finds an element that matches a condition:

```
maestro query [text=regex] [id=regex]
```
