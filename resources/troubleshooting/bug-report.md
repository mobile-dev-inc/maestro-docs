# Bug report

This page explains how to report a bug in Maestro and how to attach context so the team can triage your issue quickly. Use it when you hit a problem that is not covered in Known issues.

### How to report an issue

If you encounter an issue or bug while using Maestro, report it by opening a GitHub issue.

1. Go to [Create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/mobile-dev-inc/maestro/issues/new/choose).
2. Choose the issue type that best matches your report.
3. Follow the instructions in the issue template. Filling out the template helps the team triage your report faster.

### Collecting context with `maestro bugreport`&#x20;

To provide the Maestro team with more context about your environment, run the `bugreport` subcommand before creating a GitHub issue:

```bash
maestro bugreport
```

This command collects diagnostic data from your machine and saves it to a folder. After the command completes, attach the generated `.zip` files from that folder to your GitHub issue.

The collected data includes:

* Maestro process logs
* System information (Maestro version, operating system version, and device CPU architecture)

Once the command finishes, it prints the path to the folder where the data was written.

When creating a new issue or bug report, be sure to attach the `.zip` files generated by this command. This information helps the Maestro team reproduce and diagnose the problem more efficiently.
