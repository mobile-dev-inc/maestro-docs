# Continuous Mode

This command starts a test in a continuous mode. That is, test will be automatically restarted whenever you make a change to the test file. This is particularly convenient when writing a new test from ground up:

```
maestro test -c flow.yaml
```

Check out the Reference section of the docs to learn about all the commands you can execute.
