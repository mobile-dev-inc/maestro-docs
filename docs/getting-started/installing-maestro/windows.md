### Pre-Requisites

1. Powershell is installed in Windows system.
2. Install android studio in windows machine.
3. Add ANDROID\_HOME to your windows environment variable.
   1. To check if your ANDROID\_HOME setup is correctly done, open a powershell terminal and run this command `adb --version.`
   2. Note down the adb version.
4. Install Java JDK 11 and set JAVA\_HOME
   1. Run `java  --version` to check if the java is installed correctly.

## Steps <a href="#8b4a" id="8b4a"></a>

1. Install WSL2 (Window Subsystem for Linux)
2. Install Java 11
3. Install Maestro

With recent Windows 11, Microsoft have made it pretty easy to install Windows Subsystem For Linux aka WSL

In order to install WSL, open Powershell As Administrator and run following command:

wsl --install
```

After running the above command, follow through instructions and restart the computer.

Install [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) application for refreshing terminal experience.

Set your linux username and password (Something that you will not forget).

Run following 2 commands to update your Ubuntu system. Enter password when prompted.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

## 2. Install Java <a href="#5521" id="5521"></a>

```bash
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
```

### Let's set you up to use android in your freshly installed WSL2



* Download android command line tools zip file from [android official site.](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* Use these [instruction](https://developer.android.com/studio/install#linux) to setup android command lines correctly in your WSL2 .
* Make sure you have ANDROID\_HOME in your environment variable of WSL2 as well.
* To check that everything went good, do following:
  * Close and relaunch terminal
  * Run `adb --version` and see that adb version is shown
  * Since everything is installed fresh, your WSL 2 adb version should perfectly match with windows adb version that we noted down as part of pre-requisites.



**It's time to put some magical elixir and make sure you are able to use android emulators with your WSL2 correctly.**

_Please follow below steps to setup the bridge._

* Fire up your android emulator on windows.
* Once android emulator is up and running, open a POWERSHELL PROMPT.
* Run this command in Powershell `adb -a -P 5037 nodaemon server`
* Keep the powershell windows open.
* Now open your WSL2 terminal and run these commands.
  * `adb kill-server`&#x20;
  * `export ADB_SERVER_SOCKET=tcp:<WINDOWS_IPV4_ADDR>:5037`&#x20;
  * `adb devices`
    * You should see your connected emulator successfully now.





### All Done ?

Yes at this point you are free to start your automation.

* [Write your first flow](https://maestro.mobile.dev/getting-started/writing-your-first-flow)
* How to run my flow?
  * To run your flow run this command in your WSL2 terminal\
    `maestro --host <WINDOWS_IPV4_ADDR> test flow.yaml`
* Check out the [full documentation](https://maestro.mobile.dev/)

## Known Issue <a href="#2884" id="2884"></a>



```
If your android emulator is not up and running in windows host, the maestro test
command fails to find installed emulator.
At this point it is recommended that you fire up emulator before running the flow 
using maestro.
```
