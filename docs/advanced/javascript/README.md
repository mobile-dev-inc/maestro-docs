# JavaScript

Maestro supports a minimal subset of vanilla JavaScript APIs with some purpose-built Maestro extensions. Though none of the functions that allow interaction with the OS are available (i.e. there is no access to the filesystem), those scripts offer just enough functionality to write more sophisticated conditions or make HTTP requests.
