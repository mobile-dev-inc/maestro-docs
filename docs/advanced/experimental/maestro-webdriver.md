# Maestro WebDriver

Maestro has experimental support for running flows on Web since version `1.21.0` and here you can read more on how to get started trying it out!

### Running your first web flow

It doesn't take much to get started with Maestro on web -- simply replace `appId` with the website you want to launch and then write your flows as usual.

```
appId: "https://maestro.mobile.dev"
---
- launchApp
- tapOn:
    id: "Searchâ€¦"
    index: 1
- inputText: "Tap On View"
- tapOn: "Go to page"
- assertVisible: "Taps on a view on the screen.*"
```

### Maestro Studio support

You can use the WebDriver in Studio as well according to the following steps:

1. Make sure you have no emulators/simulators running
2. Run `maestro studio`
3. When prompted to select a device, pick `Chromium Desktop Browser (Experimental)` and Studio will launch with the WebDriver
4. Studio will launch with Maestro automatically opening up `https://maestro.mobile.dev` -- in order to redirect to another page, simply execute a `- launchApp: "https://yoursite.com"` in the command executor to have Maestro redirect to the site of your choice.
5. That's it! You can now explore the full functionality of Maestro WebDriver.&#x20;

### Caveats

#### Installation

WebDriver relies on Google Chrome being installed, so make sure that Google Chrome is installed on your system - you can find official installation instructions [here](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95346?hl=en\&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop). If you run into any weird errors, please reach out on Slack and we'll try to help you out.

#### Commands pending implementation

Note that not all Maestro commands have been fully implemented in the WebDriver yet. The following commands are pending implementation:

* Swipe
* Screen recording
* Setting location

#### Maestro Cloud support

Web flows are currently not supported on Maestro Cloud but something that we are actively exploring, so please do not hesitate to reach out in our [public Slack channel](https://mobile-dev-inc.slack.com/ssb/redirect).
