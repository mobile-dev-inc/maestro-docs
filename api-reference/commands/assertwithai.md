# assertWithAI

{% hint style="warning" %}

This is an **experimental** feature powered by LLM technology. All feedback is
welcome.

{% endhint %}

```yaml
- assertWithAI:
    assertion: Login and password text fields are visible.
```

Takes a screenshot, uploads it to an LLM with a pre-made prompt combined with
`assertion`, and asks the model if assertion is true.

### When to use?

We hope for `assertWithAI` to be useful when it's hard (or even impossible) to
write the assertion using default assertion commands.

Asserting the presence of a two-factor authentication prompt is a good example.

```yaml
- assertWithAI:
    assertion: A two-factor authentication prompt, with space for 6 digits, is visible.
```


### Output

Output is generated in HTML and JSON formats in the folder for the individual
test run:
