# assertWithAI

{% hint style="warning" %}

This is an **experimental** feature powered by LLM technology.

{% endhint %}

### When to use?

{% hint style="warning" %}

As all things generative AI, `assertWithAI` can be very helpful, but don't trust
it blindly.

{% endhint %}

`assertWithAI` is useful when it's hard (or even impossible) to write the
assertion using default assertion commands.

Asserting the presence of a two-factor authentication prompt is a good example.

```yaml
- assertWithAI:
    assertion: A two-factor authentication prompt, with space for 6 digits, is visible.
```
