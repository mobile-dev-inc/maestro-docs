# scrollUntilVisible

To scroll towards a direction until an element becomes visible in the view hierarchy, use the following command:

<pre class="language-yaml"><code class="lang-yaml"><strong>- scrollUntilVisible:
</strong>    element:
      id: "viewId" # or any other selector
    direction: DOWN # DOWN|UP|LEFT|RIGHT (optional, default: DOWN)
    timeout: 50000 # (optional, default: 20000) ms
    speed: 40 # 0-100 (optional, default: 40) Scroll speed. Higher values scroll faster.
    visibilityPercentage: 100 # 0-100 (optional, default: 100) Percentage of element visible in viewport
    centerElement: false # true|false (optional, default: false)
</code></pre>

Please refer to the [Selectors](../selectors.md) page for a full list of supported selectors.

### Direction

The scroll will move towards the direction specified `DOWN|UP|LEFT|RIGHT`. For example, if `DOWN` is specified then it will start scrolling towards the bottom of the screen.



### Timeout

The timeout (in miliseconds) defines how long it should scroll and look for the specified element. The test fails if the timeout ends before the specified element is visible. If the element is visible, the test will move on with the next command / step.



### Center Element

If enabled, it will attempt to stop when the element is closer to the screen center.&#x20;

In case it's not possible to bring the element to the center (i.e it's the last element in the list), it will stop scrolling after few attempts.

```yaml
- scrollUntilVisible:
    centerElement: true
    element:
      text: "Item 6"
```



### Visibility Percentage

By default an element will be considered visible if it is fully displayed in the viewport. You can adjust that threshold by modifying `visibilityPercentage`.



### Example

If you want to scroll until the text "My text" is visible you can run the following command:

```yaml
- scrollUntilVisible:
    element: "My text" # or any other selector
    direction: DOWN
```

If we want to scroll towards the bottom until a view with id `com.example.resource.some_view_id` becomes visible, you can use the `id` selector like this:

```yaml
- scrollUntilVisible:
    element:
      id: ".*some_view_id" # or any other selector
    direction: DOWN
```
