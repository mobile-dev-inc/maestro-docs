# setDarkMode

`setDarkMode` allows controlling the system "dark mode" of the device. You can enable or disable dark mode (aka: "light mode") with this command:

```yaml
- setDarkMode: enabled # Puts the device in dark mode
- setDarkMode: disabled # Puts the device in light mode
```

If you want to toggle between dark mode and light mode, see [toggleDarkMode](./toggledarkmode.md).
