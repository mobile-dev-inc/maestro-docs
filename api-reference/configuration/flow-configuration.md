# Flow configuration

The following properties can be configured on a given Flow:

* `appId`: defines what app the Flow should start when running `launchApp` (required)
* `name`: custom name for the Flow if you don't want to use the filename (optional)
* `tags`: list of tags that this Flow is part of. More information regarding tags can be found [here](../../cli/tags.md). (optional)
* `env`: map of environment variables that should be made available for this Flow
* `onFlowStart`: This is a hook that takes a list of Maestro commands as an argument. These commands will be executed before the initiation of each flow. Typically, this hook is used to run various setup scripts.
* `onFlowComplete`: This hook accepts a list of Maestro commands that are executed upon the completion of each flow. It's important to note that these commands will run regardless of whether a particular flow has ended successfully or has encountered a failure. Typically, this hook is used to run various teardown / cleanup scripts.
