# Limits

Maestro Cloud applies a **soft limit of 15 minutes** per test execution.

{% hint style="warning" %}
After 15 minutes of execution, your test may be stopped at any time.
{% endhint %}

Ensure your Flows are optimized for speed and efficiency to stay within this limit. For longer test suites, consider breaking them into smaller, parallelizable Flows.
