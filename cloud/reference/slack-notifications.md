# Slack Notifications

{% hint style="info" %}
ðŸš€ **Cloud Plan** required - get started for free at [**maestro.dev**](https://signin.maestro.dev/sign-up)
{% endhint %}

You can set up Maestro to notify you and your team about results from **a specific project when** [running in the cloud](../run-maestro-tests-in-the-cloud.md). That's useful to easily keep track if your app is working as expected.



1. Go to the settings in your Maestro Console

2. Click on the `Connect Slack` button

{% hint style="info" %}
Then you are going to be redirected to the slack page, where you need to authorize the integration and select the channel you want to receive the notifications.
{% endhint %}

3. After you have authorized the integration, you will be redirected back to the Maestro Console, and the integration will be enabled.

4. That's it! When an upload finishes a message will be posted in your channel.

5. If you want to disable the integration or change the channel that receives the notifications, you can easily do it in the settings page.
