# Slack Notifications


You can set up Robin to notify you and your team about upload results from **a specific project**. That's useful to easily keep track if your app is working as expected.&#x20;


1. Go to the settings in your Robin Console

2. Click on the `Connect Slack` button

   {% hint style="info" %}
   Then you are going to be redirected to the slack page, where you need to authorize the integration and select the channel you want to receive the notifications.
   {% endhint %}

3. After you have authorized the integration, you will be redirected back to the Robin Console, and the integration will be enabled.

4. That's it! When an upload finishes a message will be posted in your channel.
